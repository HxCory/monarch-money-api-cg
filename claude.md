# Monarch Money Custom Budgeting Analysis

## Project Overview
Build a custom budgeting analysis tool using the unofficial Monarch Money API to handle credit card debt payoff accounting more accurately than Monarch Money's native features allow.

## Goals
- Account for credit card debt payoff in budgeting calculations
- Get more accurate budget insights by distinguishing debt payoff from regular spending
- Create custom analysis not currently possible in Monarch Money

## Technical Stack
- **Language**: Python (user is comfortable with Python, prefers it over JavaScript)
- **API**: Unofficial Monarch Money API
  - Repository: https://github.com/HxCory/monarch-money-api-cg
  - Python-based API wrapper for Monarch Money

## Credit Card Debt Analysis (Details TBD)
User will provide more details on specific requirements, but initial considerations include:
- Distinguishing between new credit card purchases vs. paying down existing balances
- Tracking progress toward payoff goals separately from regular spending
- Potentially handling multiple cards with different strategies

## Output Format
To be determined - options include:
- Console reports
- Exported files (CSV/Excel)
- Visualizations
- Simple web dashboard

## Next Steps
1. Explore the Monarch Money API structure and available endpoints
2. Define specific requirements for credit card debt accounting
3. Design the analysis output format
4. Build the custom budgeting tool

## User Preferences
- Prefers Python over JavaScript
- Looking for practical, accurate budgeting insights
- Working on this via Claude Code on iOS mobile initially
